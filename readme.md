<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Hello World Docker ?
Let's try building a straightforward Flask application and Dockerizing it. We will look at how to host a flask application inside a container and expose the port to use it outside the container network. Now let's get going...

#### What you will learn ?
* Writing a docker file.
* Running basic commands to build an image and run a container.

#### Prerequisites
* [Docker-desktop] should be installed on your machine
* Python and Flask installed

### Technologies Used 
* Docker üê≥
* Python
* Flask 

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started
This Flask application will create a simple webserver which will return below text when the user will browse [http://127.0.0.1:5000]


### Steps to follow
* Clone Repo
  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/6613pranav/hello-world-docker-flask.git
  ```
* Install all the dependencies to run Flask Application
  ```sh
   pip install -r requirement.txt
  ```
* Run the flask App
  ```sh
  flask --app flask_app run -h 0.0.0.0
  ```
Great! Now that we saw how we can run a flask app on the local system, we will dockerize the same and run the container to get the above output.

### Understanding about the commands written in Docker file
* This commands pulls the public Python image from [docker-hub]
   ```sh
   FROM python:3.12.2
   ```
* Copies everything from local current working directory to image
   ```sh
   COPY . .
   ```
* This will install all the required dependencies to run the flask app.
   ```sh
   RUN pip install  -r requirements.txt
   ```
* Runs the command whenever the container is created
   ```sh
   CMD ["python", "flask_app.py"]
   ```

_Now we have learnt about the commands inside the docker file, we will see how to build the image & run the container._

### Building a docker image
```sh
docker build -t flask-app:v1 .
```
_'-t' flag is used to set the tag of image we are creating, in out case the image name is 'flask-app' and tag is 'v1'_

### Creating a container from above image & running the same
```sh
docker run -p 3000:5000 flask-app:v1 
```
_'-p' tag is used to bind port from container to local machine, in our case we are binding port 3000 (local machine) to port 5000 (container)_
